# ComfyUI HunyuanVideo-Foley 🎵

Generate high-fidelity, synchronized foley audio for any video directly within ComfyUI, powered by Tencent's HunyuanVideo-Foley model.

This custom node set provides a modular and offline-capable workflow for AI sound effect generation.

> **Note:** The lighter weight hunyuanvideo_foley_xl.pth model has been added.

## ✨ Features

-   **High-Fidelity Audio:** Generates 48kHz stereo audio using the advanced DAC VAE.
-   **Video-to-Audio Synchronization:** Leverages the Synchformer model to ensure audio events are timed with visual actions.
-   **Text-Guided Control:** Use positive and negative text prompts, powered by the CLAP model, to creatively direct the type of sound you want to generate.
-   **Flexible Model Choice:** Includes support for the original high-quality model and a smaller, faster XL variant.
-   **Modular:** The workflow is broken into logical `Loader`, `Sampler`, and `VAE Decode` nodes, mirroring the standard Stable Diffusion workflow.
-   **Integrated:** Accepts video frames directly from popular loader nodes like `VHS_LoadVideoPath`, avoiding redundant file operations.
-   **VRAM Management:** Caches models in VRAM for fast, repeated generations. Includes an optional "Low VRAM" mode to unload models after use, ideal for memory-constrained systems.
-   **Offline Capable:** No automatic model downloads. Once you've downloaded the models, the node works entirely offline.

## 📥 Download Models (Crucial Step)

This node requires you to download the model files manually and organize them in a specific folder structure. This ensures the node works offline and gives you full control.

1.  Navigate to `ComfyUI/models/`.
2.  Create a new folder named `hunyuan_foley`.

3.  **Download the following and place them inside your `hunyuan_foley` folder**

    *   **Hunyuan-Foley Base Models** from [Tencent/HunyuanVideo-Foley on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo-Foley/tree/main):
        *   `hunyuanvideo_foley.pth`
        *   `hunyuanvideo_foley_xl.pth` (Optional: A smaller, faster alternative model)
        *   `synchformer_state_dict.pth`
        *   `vae_128d_48k.pth`

    *   **SigLIP Vision Model** from [google/siglip2-base-patch16-512 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-base-patch16-512/tree/main):
        *   Create a new folder named `siglip2`.
        *   Download `model.safetensors`, `config.json` and `preprocessor_config.json` place them inside the `siglip2` folder.

    *   **CLAP Text Model** from [laion/larger_clap_general on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/laion/larger_clap_general/tree/refs%2Fpr%2F2):
        *   Create a new folder named `clap`.
        *   Download `model.safetensors`, `config.json`, `merges.txt` and `vocab.json` and place them inside the `clap` folder.

**Your final folder structure should look exactly like this:**

```
ComfyUI/
└── models/
    └── hunyuan_foley/        <-- You will see this folder selected in the Loader node 
        ├── hunyuanvideo_foley.pth
        ├── hunyuanvideo_foley_xl.pth
        ├── synchformer_state_dict.pth
        ├── vae_128d_48k.pth
        │
        ├── siglip2/          <-- Subfolder for SigLIP2
        │   ├── model.safetensors
        │   ├── config.json
        │   └── preprocessor_config.json
        │
        └── clap/             <-- Subfolder for CLAP
            ├── model.safetensors
            ├── config.json
            ├── merges.txt
            └── vocab.json

## 🚀 Usage & Nodes

The workflow is designed to be modular and familiar to ComfyUI users.

#### 1. `Hunyuan-Foley model loader`
This node loads the main diffusion model and all necessary conditioning models (SigLIP2, CLAP, Synchformer) into VRAM. These models are cached for fast subsequent generations.
-   **Inputs:**
    -   `model_path_name`: The model folder you created.
    -   `foley_checkpoint_name`: A dropdown to select which main model checkpoint to use (`.pth` file). Allows switching between the base and XL models.
-   **Outputs:**
    -   `FOLEY_MODEL`: The loaded models, ready to be passed to the sampler.

#### 2. `Hunyuan-Foley VAE loader`
This node loads the specialized DAC audio VAE used for decoding the final sound. Keeping it separate saves VRAM during the sampling process.
-   **Inputs:**
    -   `vae_name`: A dropdown to select the `vae_128d_48k.pth` file. It will search your `hunyuan_foley` model folder.
-   **Outputs:**
    -   `VAE`: The loaded DAC VAE model.

#### 3. `Hunyuan-Foley Sampler`
This is the core node where the audio generation happens. It takes video frames, prompts, and sampling parameters to generate a latent representation of the audio.
-   **Inputs:**
    -   `foley_model`: The model from the `Hunyuan-Foley model loader`.
    -   `video_frames` (IMAGE): A batch of video frames, typically from a video loader node like `VHS_LoadVideoPath`.
    -   `fps` (FLOAT): The framerate of the original video. This is crucial for correct timing. You can get this from a node like `VHS_VideoInfoSource`.
    -   `prompt`: Your text description of the desired sound.
    -   `negative_prompt`: A text description of sounds to avoid (e.g., "noisy, harsh, muffled").
    -   `guidance_scale`, `steps`, `seed`: Standard diffusion sampling parameters.
-   **Outputs:**
    -   `LATENT`: A latent tensor representing the generated audio. This is passed to the VAE Decode node.

#### 4. `Hunyuan-Foley VAE Decode`
This node takes the latent tensor from the sampler and converts it into a final audio waveform. It also contains the VRAM management toggle.
-   **Inputs:**
    -   `samples`: The `LATENT` output from the `Hunyuan-Foley Sampler`.
    -   `vae`: The `VAE` output from the `Hunyuan-Foley VAE loader`.
    -   `unload_models_after_use` (Boolean Toggle):
        -   **`False` (Default):** Keeps the main models in VRAM for fast subsequent generations.
        -   **`True` (Low VRAM Mode):** Frees VRAM by moving the main models to system RAM after generation is complete. The next generation will be slower as it requires a full reload.
-   **Outputs:**
    -   `AUDIO`: The final audio waveform, which can be connected to `Save Audio`, `Preview Audio`, or a `Video Combine` node.

### 💡 Example Workflow & Tips
-   **VRAM Requirement:** For the best performance (keeping models cached), a GPU with approximately **10-12GB of VRAM** is recommended.
-   **Initial Load:** The first time you run a workflow, the `Hunyuan-Foley model loader` will take a moment to load all models from disk into VRAM. Subsequent runs in the same session will be faster as long as models are not unloaded.
-   **XL Model Advantage:** The `hunyuanvideo_foley_xl.pth` model is smaller than the original. It may offer quicker loading and inference, making it a great choice for users prioritizing speed or working with more limited VRAM.

-   **Connecting The Sampler (Recommended Workflow):**
    1.  Use a `VHS_LoadVideoPath` node to load your video. This will output the frames (`IMAGE`) and video information (`VHS_VIDEOINFO`).
    2.  Connect the `IMAGE` output from `VHS_LoadVideoPath` directly to the `video_frames` input on the `Hunyuan-Foley Sampler`.
    3.  Add a `VHS_VideoInfoSource` node.
    4.  Connect the `VHS_VIDEOINFO` output from the loader to the `VHS_VideoInfoSource` node.
    5.  Connect the `fps` output from `VHS_VideoInfoSource` to the `fps` input on the `Hunyuan-Foley Sampler`.

-   **Low VRAM Mode:** If you are running low on VRAM or only need to generate a single audio track, set the `unload_models_after_use` toggle on the `Hunyuan-Foley VAE Decode` node to `True`. This will significantly reduce the idle VRAM footprint after the workflow completes.
